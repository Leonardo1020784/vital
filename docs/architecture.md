## 1. Overview

Vital is a modular, extensible, and polyglot programming language ecosystem built to support the complexity and diversity of global health.  
It integrates with existing data standards, infrastructure, and applications, providing a universal layer for health logic, validation, and automation.

---

## 2. Core Components

- **Parser & Compiler/Interpreter:** Reads `.vital` files, parses syntax, and executes logic.
- **Standard Library:** Core utilities (crypto, math, date, health, I/O, etc.).
- **Module System:** Supports imports, namespaces, and reusable logic.
- **Type System:** Health-focused types (codes, records, bundles, concepts).
- **Error Handling:** Robust reporting, logging, and traceability.

---

## 3. Adapters

Adapters are plug-in modules that connect Vital to:

- **Health standards:** FHIR, HL7, DICOM, ICD, SNOMED, ATC, LOINC, CPT, etc.
- **External systems:** EHRs, databases, cloud APIs (Firebase, Google Healthcare), local files.
- **Code lists:** JSON, CSV, or API-based code sets and ontologies.

Adapters expose functions and data structures into the Vital language, making health data interoperable and programmable.

---

## 4. SDKs & APIs

SDKs provide seamless integration for developers in major languages:

- **Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Rust, Go, C#**
- Call Vital scripts from mobile, web, backend, or IoT apps
- Streamline data exchange between Vital and host environments

APIs (REST/gRPC) enable Vital as a cloud service or microservice for remote execution.

---

## 5. Backends & Execution

- **Reference Interpreter:** (Python) for prototyping, testing, and rapid iteration.
- **High-Performance Backends:** (Rust, Go, C#, C++) for production, scale, and embedded use.
- **WASM Support:** For running Vital securely in browsers, mobile, and edge devices.
- **CLI Tools:** For local scripting, automation, and DevOps.

---

## 6. Example Workflow

1. **Write Logic:** Author a `.vital` file with health logic (e.g., validate a clinical code, encrypt a record).
2. **Import Adapters:** Pull in standards (e.g., ATC, FHIR) via adapters.
3. **Run:** Execute via CLI, SDK, or APIâ€”passing in data from your app or system.
4. **Integrate:** Use SDKs to connect results to EHRs, cloud storage, or workflows.
5. **Audit:** All logic and data processing is transparent and traceable.

---

## 7. Extensibility

- **Adapters:** Add support for new standards, code sets, or APIs.
- **Plugins:** Extend the language with analytics, ML, or custom functions.
- **Community Modules:** Share and reuse health logic globally.

---

## 8. Security & Privacy

- **Encryption & Masking:** Native support for secure data handling.
- **Access Control:** Role-based and context-aware logic.
- **Audit Logs:** Track and verify every operation.
- **Isolation:** WASM and containerized execution for untrusted code.
