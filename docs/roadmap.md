## 1. Vision & Guiding Principles

- **Health Access Made Easy:** Lower the barrier for anyone, anywhere to build and share health logic.
- **Interoperability:** Connect every health system, standard, and code set.
- **Transparency & Trust:** Open, auditable health rules—no more black boxes.
- **Scalability:** From local clinics to global health systems.
- **Extensibility:** Adapters, plugins, and SDKs for every context.

## 2. Roadmap Stages

### Stage 1: Language Core & Foundation
- [x] Define core syntax, types, and semantics.
- [x] Create initial interpreter (Python).
- [x] Implement basic stdlib (crypto, math, health).
- [x] Modular architecture for adapters and plugins.

### Stage 2: Adapters & Interoperability
- [x] Adapters for key health standards (FHIR, DICOM, HL7, ICD, SNOMED, ATC, CPT, LOINC).
- [x] JSON file support for code lists.
- [ ] Example integrations with real health data (public datasets).
- [ ] Community-contributed adapters.

### Stage 3: SDKs & Developer Experience
- [x] SDKs: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, C#.
- [ ] CLI tools for scripting, formatting, and testing.
- [ ] VSCode extension for syntax highlighting and snippets.
- [ ] Example apps and workflows.

### Stage 4: Security & Privacy
- [x] Built-in encryption and masking.
- [ ] Role-based access control.
- [ ] Audit logging and traceability.
- [ ] Pluggable privacy-preserving computation.

### Stage 5: Scalability & Performance
- [ ] Polyglot backends (Rust, Go, C#).
- [ ] JIT/VM for high performance.
- [ ] Distributed execution support.

### Stage 6: Globalization & Community
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n) for language and docs.
- [ ] Regional/local code set support.
- [ ] Community governance and open standards.
- [ ] Health equity and accessibility initiatives.

## 4. Community & Governance

- **Open Development:** All code, specs, and discussions are public.
- **Contribution Guide:** See [contributing.md](contributing.md).
- **Governance:** Transparent decision-making, with representation from health, tech, and patient communities.

## 5. How to Get Involved

- **Developers:** Contribute to language core, adapters, SDKs, or tools.
- **Domain Experts:** Propose health logic, code sets, or protocols.
- **Organizations:** Pilot Vital in your health system.
- **Everyone:** Share feedback, report issues, help shape the future!
