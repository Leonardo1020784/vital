# Vital Project Governance

The **Vital** programming language and ecosystem are built for the public good: open, transparent, and shaped by the global health and developer communities.  
This document explains how decisions are made, how contributors can participate, and how we ensure Vital remains a trustworthy, collaborative, and sustainable project.

## 1. Principles

- **Openness:** All code, discussions, and decisions are public.
- **Transparency:** Roadmaps, issues, and proposals are visible to all.
- **Inclusivity:** Welcoming contributions from all backgrounds, disciplines, and regions.
- **Health First:** The best interests of global health guide all decisions.
- **Trust:** Code, rules, and governance are auditable and fair.

## 2. Governance Structure

Vital is governed by a **meritocratic, community-driven model** inspired by successful open source projects.

- **Core Maintainers:** Lead development, review contributions, manage releases.
- **Contributors:** Anyone submitting code, docs, adapters, or community support.
- **Advisory Board (future):** Experts in health, technology, and ethics to provide guidance.
- **Community:** Users, implementers, partners, and all stakeholders with a voice.

---

## 3. Decision-Making Process

- **Consensus-Seeking:** Most decisions are made by seeking consensus among active contributors and maintainers.
- **Proposals:** Significant changes (language features, roadmap, governance) are proposed as [GitHub issues](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/), discussed openly, and require approval from at least two core maintainers.
- **Voting:** For major breaking changes or disputes, a simple majority vote among core maintainers decides.
- **Transparency:** All proposals, discussions, and decisions are documented publicly on GitHub.
